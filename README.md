# POSN Computer Science – Camp 2 Solutions (March – April 2024)

Following Camp 1, I passed the qualifying exam and earned a seat in **POSN Computer Science Camp 2**, hosted on the KMUTT campus from March to April 2024. This repository collects my personal solutions to the programming problems we tackled there.

## A Few Words About the Experience

Camp 2 was my first time living in a dorm away from family—though I still headed home on weekends. I shared a room with a high-school friend, and most nights were calm… except one memorable Sunday (technically Monday at 2 a.m.) when a group of seniors next door chanted their way through an _Arena of Valor_ match. I arrived at the Dynamic Programming lecture half-asleep.

Despite the occasional late-night soundtrack, the overall experience was excellent. The mentors pushed us well beyond Camp 1’s C-language basics into serious algorithmic territory—data structures, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, knapsack variants, and other foundational theory—this time in C++. Their insight and enthusiasm left a lasting mark; they’re a big reason I chose a pure CS path instead of the more common Computer Engineering track.

We still enjoyed the traditional end-of-camp buffet, and KMUTT’s facilities were great. Choosing MUIC afterward felt like either a 4-D chess move or the dumbest decision of my life—I’ll know in a few years—but the international exposure was worth the gamble.

On tooling: I switched from VS Code’s Vim key-bindings to LunarVim (Neovim) right after buying my MacBook. Two years later, macOS remains my daily driver; Unix life is decidedly viable.

### Exam-Day Plot Twist

One standout episode came during the next round qualification.  
* **Round 1 (morning)**: I cracked a hard problem, landed 3rd place, and sat comfortably inside the top-five cutoff.  
* **Round 2 (afternoon)**: an easier set—yet I got trapped by the very first flood-fill problem, wrestling a stubborn segmentation fault for an hour. I finally gave up, walked out early, and watched my ranking slide out of contention. My parting commit message said it best: “_never use C/C++ in competitive programming again_.”  
  In retrospect it was fair—if you can’t squash the bug, you shouldn’t represent the team. That setback kicked off my Rust journey, and I haven’t looked back.
